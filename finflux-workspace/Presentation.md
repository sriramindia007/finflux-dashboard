# FINFLUX Analytics
## C-Suite Demo: Executive Health Badges
A guide to the core financial & operational metrics.

---

## The Executive View
**Purpose:** A single-glance summary answering the fundamental board-level questions:
- Are we profitable?
- Is our portfolio healthy? 
- Are we compliant and stable?

*These six badges benchmark our real-time performance against industry averages and internal targets.*

---

## NIM (Net Interest Margin)
**Current: 11.3% | Industry Avg: 11.2%**

- **What it is:** The core profitability of our lending activity (Interest Earned minus Interest Paid, divided by average assets). 
- **Speaking Point:** "Our NIM stands at a healthy 11.3%, marginally outperforming the industry average. This indicates our pricing strategy is highly effective and we are managing our cost of capital efficiently."

---

## ROA (Return on Assets)
**Current: 4.20% | Industry Avg: 3.1%**

- **What it is:** Measures how efficiently we are using our total assets to generate net income.
- **Speaking Point:** "At 4.20%, our Return on Assets is exceptional, well above the 3.1% industry standard. We are extracting maximum value from our asset base, proving our operations are highly lean and profitable."

---

## CRAR (Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio)
**Current: 19.4% | Minimum Limit: 15%**

- **What it is:** A regulatory measure of our capital cushion against potential losses (Capital Adequacy Ratio).
- **Speaking Point:** "We are highly capitalized. Our CRAR is 19.4%, sitting comfortably above the RBI's 15% minimum threshold. We have a robust safety buffer, giving us plenty of runway for aggressive, safe scaling."

---

## COLL. EFF. (Collection Efficiency)
**Current: 97.1% | Internal Target: 99%**

- **What it is:** The percentage of due EMI collections actually realized.
- **Speaking Point:** "Our collection efficiency is currently at 97.1%. While this is a strong number, it sits slightly below our ambitious internal target of 99%. This tells our operations team exactly where to focus field efforts this week."

---

## PAR 30+ (Portfolio At Risk > 30 Days)
**Current: 1.97% | Industry Avg: 3.6%**

- **What it is:** The percentage of our total Gross Loan Portfolio (GLP) that is overdue by 30 days or more.
- **Speaking Point:** "Our asset quality is stellar. With a PAR 30+ of just 1.97% against an industry average of 3.6%, our credit scoring and underwriting processes are proving to be top-tier, effectively keeping bad debt off our books."

---

## OER (Operating Expense Ratio)
**Current: 5.9% | Target: <6.2%**

- **What it is:** Our total operational costs divided by our average portfolio.
- **Speaking Point:** "We are operating highly efficiently. Our OER is at 5.9%, successfully beating our sub-6.2% target limit. We are growing our portfolio without proportionally ballooning our overhead costs."

---

## Summary
- **Profitability:** Beating industry averages (NIM & ROA).
- **Stability:** Heavily capitalized and compliant (CRAR).
- **Quality:** Superior underwriting with low default risk (PAR). 
- **Efficiency:** Lean operations on track (OER) with a slight operations focus needed on Collections.
